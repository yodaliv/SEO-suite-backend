Hello.
When I entered college, I chose IT field.
It was because of the conviction that the IT industry can dominate the world.
In order to realize my dreams and ideals, I participated in numerous project developments when I was in college, and after graduating from college, I became a member of a renowned group and proceeded with the development.
At that time, as I accumulated a lot of development experience, I came to think that I was not using this development experience only for the development of the group.
Thousands of people have valuable ideas, but they are struggling to find capable developers to make them happen.
I will do my best for those people.
Currently I am a new freelancer.
As I read the project requirements, I want to break the old mindset of people who think they can't develop this project as a new freelancer.
I think it's a task that even a new freelancer can do with the ability.
Please believe in my abilities.
Thank you for reading my article.
I look forward to your reply.
